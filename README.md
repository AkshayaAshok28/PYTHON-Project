# PYTHON-Project
Indian Food Data analysis using Python
-----


# 📌 Overview

This project explores the Indian Food Dataset using Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
It covers beginner to advanced concepts such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and data merging/concatenation.

The goal of the project is to strengthen data analytics skills by applying practical techniques on a real dataset.

## 📊 Dataset

Dataset name: Indian Food Dataset

- **Rows:** 255

- **Columns:** 9

- **Features include:** dish name, diet type, course, region, state, flavor profile, prep time, cook time.

-------


## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python** → Google Colab

- **Pandas** → data handling & preprocessing

- **NumPy** → numerical computations

- **Matplotlib** → basic data visualizations

- **Seaborn** → advanced visualizations (heatmap, violin plots, boxplots)

------


## 🔎 Analysis Performed

- Data cleaning & handling missing values

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas

# Visualizations:

- Bar chart of dishes by region

- Pie chart of vegetarian vs non-vegetarian dishes

- Histogram of cooking time distribution

- Line chart for dishes by prep time

- Heatmap of missing values

- Violin & boxplots for comparisons

# NumPy practice: arrays, statistics, reshaping, slicing

# Merge & Concat operations to combine DataFrames

---------


## 📈 Key Insights

- Majority of dishes are vegetarian, especially from North & West India.

- Average cooking time is around 30 minutes; prep time ~15 minutes.

- Most dishes fall under main course or snack.

- Some missing data exists in state and region columns.

- Merge and concat techniques helped simulate combining multiple datasets.
